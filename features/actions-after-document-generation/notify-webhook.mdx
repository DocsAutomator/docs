The Notify Webhook feature allows DocsAutomator to send notifications to external services when documents are successfully generated. This enables integration with other applications and workflows.

## Purpose

Notify other services about successful document creations through webhook callbacks, allowing you to trigger downstream processes or log document generation events in external systems.

## Configuration

### Webhook URL Registration

Register a webhook address that will receive notifications once documents are created. DocsAutomator makes POST requests to your specified endpoint when generation completes.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Test">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Additional Parameters via API

The system supports sending supplementary data alongside webhook notifications through the `webhookParams` object in API requests.

```json
{
  "docId": "your-automation-id",
  "data": {
    "customer_name": "Acme Corp"
  },
  "webhookParams": {
    "orderId": "ORD-12345",
    "customerId": "CUST-789"
  }
}
```

These parameters appear as `additionalParams` in the webhook payload sent to your endpoint.
