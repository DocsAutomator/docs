DocsAutomator allows you to preserve Google Docs after generation for continued editing, complementing PDF exports. Generated Google Docs become editable files stored in your Google Drive, enabling post-generation modifications.

## Configuration

You can optionally set a "Google Doc Destination Folder" to specify where documents are stored in Google Drive.

## Sharing & Visibility Settings

<Note>
Generated Google Docs inherit sharing permissions from their parent folder. For example, if a folder has view-only public sharing enabled, the saved Google Doc will have the same access restrictions.
</Note>

## Airtable Integration

When enabling "Save Google Doc?" with Airtable as your data source, an additional field appears in the Airtable mapping section. This allows you to select a field where the Google Doc link will be stored automatically.

## API Integration

Using DocsAutomator's API, the response includes a `googleDocUrl` key containing the link to the generated Google Doc.

```json
{
  "pdfUrl": "https://...",
  "googleDocUrl": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/..."
}
```

## Dynamic Subfolder Creation

DocsAutomator supports automatic nested folder generation using static text and dynamic placeholders for organized storage.

### Static Text Examples

```
Reports
Invoices
2024/Q1
Contracts/Signed
```

### Placeholder Examples

```
{{client_name}}                           # Creates folder by client
{{date}}_Documents                        # Date-based naming
{{year}}/{{month}}                        # Nested date structure
Clients/{{client_name}}/{{year}}          # Multi-level organization
{{department}}/{{project_name}}           # Department structure
```

### Placeholder Entry Methods

- **Quick Method**: Type `/` to browse available placeholders
- **Manual Method**: Enter placeholders using `{{placeholder_name}}` format

### Folder Hierarchy Behavior

- Forward slashes (`/`) create nested structures
- Non-existent folders are created automatically
- Existing folders are reused (no duplicates)
- Multiple nesting levels are supported

### Limitations

<Warning>
- **Line Item Placeholders**: Line item fields (multiple data rows) cannot be used in subfolder names—only single-value fields are supported.
- **Empty Placeholder Values**: When placeholders lack values, they're removed from the path, and documents save to the closest valid parent folder or main destination.
</Warning>
