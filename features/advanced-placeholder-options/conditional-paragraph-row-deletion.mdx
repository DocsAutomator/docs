This feature allows you to automatically remove entire lines or rows from documents when placeholder values are empty or not provided.

## Use Case

In document scenarios like invoices, if no discount is provided, the entire discount line can be deleted rather than appearing blank in the final output.

## How It Works

| Context | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Placeholders outside tables | Entire lines are deleted |
| Placeholders in tables | The complete row is deleted |
| Line items | Entire line item rows can be removed if their placeholder values are empty |

## Implementation

Line and row deletion is enabled through the settings icon adjacent to each placeholder or variable in your template.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Placeholder Settings">
    Click the gear/settings icon next to the placeholder you want to configure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Deletion">
    Enable the "Delete line/row when empty" option
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test">
    Generate a preview document with empty values to verify the deletion works correctly
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Combination

This feature can be used together with [Conditional Show/Hide](/features/advanced-placeholder-options/conditional-show-hide). When a value is hidden based on specific conditions, enabling row deletion will remove the entire line or row from the document.

## Example

**Before (with empty discount):**
```
Subtotal: $100.00
Discount:
Tax: $10.00
Total: $110.00
```

**After (with deletion enabled):**
```
Subtotal: $100.00
Tax: $10.00
Total: $110.00
```

## Key Benefit

<Tip>
Removes visual clutter and creates cleaner, more professional documents by eliminating empty fields entirely rather than leaving blank spaces.
