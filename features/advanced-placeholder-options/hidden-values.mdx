Hidden values enable you to set placeholders to "Always hide" for use as conditions in sections or as recipient email addresses without rendering the value in the document.

## Key Features

- **Conditional Usage**: Apply hidden values as conditions for sections
- **Email Recipients**: Use hidden values as recipient addresses without displaying them
- **Document Clean**: Values remain invisible in final output while still functional

1. Map the `account_manager_email` placeholder to your data source
2. Enable "Always hide" in the placeholder settings
