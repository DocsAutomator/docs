AI Field Mapping uses artificial intelligence to automatically suggest the best mapping between your template placeholders and data source fields, saving time during automation setup.

## How It Works

When you reach the field mapping step of automation setup, click the **AI Field Mapping** button. The system:

1. Reads all placeholder names from your Google Doc template
2. Reads all available fields from your connected data source
3. Uses AI to match placeholders to fields based on name similarity and field types
4. Populates the mapping dropdowns with suggested matches

<Info>
AI mapping works best when your placeholder names are descriptive and similar to your data source field names. For example, `{{client_name}}` maps well to a field called "Client Name".

| Data Source | Supported |

## Using AI Field Mapping

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Automation">
    Create an automation, connect your data source, and select your template as usual.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reach the Field Mapping Step">
    Navigate to the field mapping section where placeholders are listed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click AI Field Mapping">
    Click the AI mapping button. The system analyzes your placeholders and fields, then suggests the best matches.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Adjust">
    Review the suggested mappings. Correct any that don't match your needs using the dropdown menus. The AI may leave some fields unmapped if it isn't confident about a match.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips

- **Descriptive names help**: The more descriptive your placeholder and field names are, the better the AI suggestions will be
- **Image placeholders**: Placeholders starting with `image_` are automatically matched only to attachment-type fields
- **Review all mappings**: Always verify the AI suggestions before proceeding, especially for fields with similar names
- **Manual override**: You can manually change any mapping after the AI suggestion by selecting a different field from the dropdown
- **Unmapped fields**: If the AI is not confident about a match, it will leave the placeholder unmapped rather than guess incorrectly
