### eIDAS (Simple Electronic Signatures)

eIDAS establishes legal frameworks for electronic signatures across EU member states. DocsAutomator provides Simple Electronic Signatures (SES).

**SES Compliance:**
- Signatures capture digitally and embed into PDFs

### GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation governs personal data collection, processing, and storage for EU residents.

**DocsAutomator Compliance:**
- Personal data processed based on contractual necessity

## Security Measures

### Audit Trail

Every e-signature session maintains a tamper-evident audit trail recording:
- Session creation and document generation
- Email invitation delivery timestamps
- Signer access to signing links
- IP address and browser information per action
- Individual field completion timestamps
- Session completion and PDF finalization

### Document Integrity

- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Cryptographic hash of the original document stores for verification
- **Certificate of Completion**: Automatically generated page showing all signers, signatures, and completion timestamps

### Access Control

- **Secure Tokens**: Each signer receives unique 256-bit cryptographically random access tokens
- **Time-Limited Access**: Signing links expire after configurable periods (default: 30 days)
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks

### Infrastructure Security

- **Encryption in Transit**: All communications secured via TLS/HTTPS
- **Cloud Storage**: Documents on Google Cloud infrastructure with enterprise-grade security
- **Database Security**: MongoDB Atlas with encryption at rest and network isolation
