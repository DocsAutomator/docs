## Preview Methods

    After selecting a data source and template, a preview area appears on the right side of the interface.

    **For Airtable and ClickUp integrations:**

    **For other integrations:**
    - Use the mapping interface to associate data with placeholders in your template

  <Tab title="Preview Mode for Entire Automation">
    Enable preview mode for the complete automation workflow:
    - Applies a watermark to generated documents
    - Consumes zero document credits
