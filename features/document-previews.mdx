Generate an unlimited amount of previews without wasting credits. Document preview generation is a critical testing feature in DocsAutomator, allowing you to verify templates and integration functionality before deploying to production.

## Preview Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="From Automation Interface">
    After selecting a data source and template, a preview area appears on the right side of the interface.

    **For Airtable and ClickUp integrations:**
    - Map specific records or tasks from your selected bases, tables, spaces, or lists

    **For other integrations:**
    - Use the mapping interface to associate data with placeholders in your template
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Preview Mode for Entire Automation">
    Enable preview mode for the complete automation workflow:
    - Applies a watermark to generated PDFs
    - Consumes zero document credits
    - If "Save Google Doc" is enabled, preserves the Google Doc with a "PREVIEW — NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION" header
    - If "Save PDFs in Google Drive" is enabled, saves the watermarked PDF to your Drive folder
    - If URL writeback fields are configured, writes Google Doc URL and PDF Drive URL back to your data source
    - Document names are prefixed with `[PREVIEW]` for easy identification
    - Emails are not sent

    <Tip>
    Use this mode to test your full automation pipeline end-to-end — including Drive saves and data source writebacks — before going live.
