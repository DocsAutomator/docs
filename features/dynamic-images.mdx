DocsAutomator enables image insertion throughout documents. Images are automatically preprocessed, converted, and can be resized to optimize document quality and file size.

<Warning>
Passed images need to be publicly available on the web.
</Warning>

## Syntax

Images are declared using the `image_` prefix:

```
{{image_variableName}}
```

<CodeGroup>
```text Examples
{{image_headshot}}
{{image_product}}
{{image_companyLogo}}
{{image_signature}}
```
</CodeGroup>

This tells DocsAutomator where to insert images. You can pass single or multiple images, which are added inline within the document.

## Pre-processing & Converting

The system optimizes images before insertion:

- **Format conversion**: Images are automatically converted to .jpg format
- **Quality optimization**: Reduces file size while maintaining quality
- **PNG exception**: PNG files retain their format to preserve transparency

### Supported Formats

JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, ICO, PDF, EPS, PSD, SVG, WebP, JXR, WDP

### Image Quality Settings

Configure image handling in **Template / Document Generation Options**:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Low | Smallest file size, lower quality |
| Eco | Balanced quality and file size (recommended) |
| Good | Higher quality, larger file size |
| Best | Maximum quality, largest file size |

### Maximum Width

- Range: 200-2000 pixels
- Standard: 600px
- Example: An 8000×6000px image resizes to 600×450px

<Tip>
The "Eco" setting is recommended for balanced quality and file size in most use cases.
</Tip>

## Resizing Images

Resize individual placeholder images through DocsAutomator's interface:

- **Aspect ratio**: Always preserved during resizing
- **Single dimension**: Other dimension calculates automatically to maintain proportions
- **Both dimensions**: Image scales to fit while preserving aspect ratio

<Warning>
If the resizing parameter exceeds the maximum width in automation settings, the image will be expanded and lose quality.
</Warning>

## Passing Images via API

When using the DocsAutomator API, pass an array of image URLs for processing:

```json
{
  "docId": "your-automation-id",
  "data": {
    "image_product": "https://example.com/product.jpg",
    "image_signature": "https://example.com/signature.png"
  }
}
```

## Multiple Images

To insert multiple images for a single placeholder, pass them as an array or comma-separated URLs depending on your data source:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API">
    ```json
    {
      "image_gallery": [
        "https://example.com/image1.jpg",
        "https://example.com/image2.jpg",
        "https://example.com/image3.jpg"
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Google Sheets">
    Separate multiple image URLs with commas in your spreadsheet cell.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Airtable">
    Use an Attachment field with multiple images.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use publicly accessible URLs" icon="globe">
    Images must be accessible via public URL. Private or authenticated URLs will fail.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Optimize source images" icon="compress">
    While DocsAutomator compresses images, starting with reasonably sized images improves processing speed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use PNG for transparency" icon="square">
    If your image requires transparency (logos, overlays), use PNG format.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test with preview mode" icon="eye">
    Always test image rendering in preview mode before production.
  </Accordion>
