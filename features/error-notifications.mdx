Error notifications alert you by email when an automation fails to generate a document, so you can investigate and fix issues quickly.

## Enabling Error Notifications

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Workspace Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings > Workspace > Notifications** in the DocsAutomator dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toggle Error Notifications">
    Switch the **Error Notifications** toggle to enable email alerts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Email Recipients">
    Your account email is always included as a recipient. Add additional email addresses to notify team members or monitoring systems:
    1. Type an email address in the input field
    2. Press Enter or click the **+** button to add it
    3. Repeat for additional recipients
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

When error notifications are enabled:

- If a document generation fails for any automation in your workspace, an email alert is sent to all configured recipients
- The alert includes details about the failure to help you diagnose the issue
- Your account email always receives notifications (cannot be removed)
- Additional recipient emails can be added or removed at any time

## Managing Recipients

- **Add**: Type an email address and press Enter
- **Remove**: Click the **x** next to any additional email address
- **Disable all**: Toggle error notifications off to stop all alerts (this also clears additional recipients)

<Note>
Error notifications are workspace-wide. Enabling them covers all automations in the workspace, not just individual ones.
</Note>

## Common Error Scenarios

Errors that trigger notifications include:

| Error Type | Common Cause |
|-----------|--------------|
| Template not found | Google Doc template was deleted or permissions changed |
| Data source error | Airtable/Google Sheets connection expired or record not found |
| Rate limit exceeded | Too many document generation requests in a short period |
| Google API error | Google Docs API temporarily unavailable or quota exceeded |
| Authentication error | OAuth token expired and needs reconnection |

<Tip>
Check the [Run History](/features/run-history) for detailed error logs and timestamps for failed generations.
