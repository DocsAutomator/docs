Folders let you group related automations together, making it easier to find and manage them as your workspace grows.

## Creating Folders

1. In the DocsAutomator dashboard, click the **+ New Folder** button in the sidebar
2. Enter a name for your folder (e.g., "Client Invoices", "HR Documents", "Marketing")
3. The folder appears in the sidebar navigation

## Moving Automations to Folders

### Individual automations

Right-click an automation or use its context menu to move it into a folder. You can also move it back out to the top level.

### Bulk operations

Select multiple automations using the checkboxes, then use the bulk action menu to:

- **Move to folder**: Move all selected automations into a specific folder
- **Remove from folder**: Move all selected automations back to the top level

## Managing Folders

### Renaming

Right-click a folder in the sidebar and select **Rename** to change its name.

### Deleting

Right-click a folder and select **Delete**. When you delete a folder, the automations inside it are not deleted -- they are moved back to the top level.

<Warning>
Deleting a folder cannot be undone, but your automations are preserved.
</Warning>

## Tips

- Use folders to separate automations by client, department, or document type
- Folder names appear in the sidebar with a count of automations inside
- Each automation can only belong to one folder at a time
- Automations without a folder appear at the top level of your dashboard
