DocsAutomator allows you to configure how long generated PDFs are retained in the platform's storage system.

## Default Behavior

<Note>
For privacy reasons, DocsAutomator deletes PDFs soon after generation by default. The default setting is "immediate expiry," meaning PDFs are automatically removed shortly after they're created.
</Note>

## When Storage Matters

For most integrations—such as Airtable and Glide—storing PDFs within DocsAutomator is typically unnecessary. The platform automatically places a copy of the generated PDF into your connected data source immediately after creation.

## Adjusting Retention Settings

If you need to extend PDF retention, you can modify the expiration setting on each automation in the automation settings interface.

### Available Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Immediate | PDFs deleted shortly after generation (default) |
| 1 Day | PDFs retained for 24 hours |
| 7 Days | PDFs retained for one week |
| 30 Days | PDFs retained for one month |
| Never | PDFs retained indefinitely |
