DocsAutomator enables rendering of entire document areas dynamically using Sections. These are defined by wrapping content with opening and closing tags that include a section name.

    allowFullScreen

</Frame>

## Syntax

**Opening tag:**
```
{{section_SOME_NAME}}
```

**Closing tag:**
```
{{/section_SOME_NAME}}
```

<Note>
The closing tag requires a forward slash before `section`.
</Note>

## Example

```
{{section_premium_content}}

This entire area will only appear if the condition is met.

You can include any content here:
- Text
- Images
- Tables
- Line items

{{/section_premium_content}}
```

<Tip>
Add color to section tags in your Google Doc for easier identification within templates.

## Configuration

Once sections are defined in the template, they appear in automation settings where conditional rendering rules can be applied.

## Available Conditions

The system supports six conditional operators:

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| equals | Value exactly matches |
| does not equal | Value does not match |
| contains | Value includes substring |
| does not contain | Value excludes substring |
| exists | Value is present (not empty) |
| does not exist | Value is empty or missing |

These conditions are evaluated against placeholder values passed to the document.
