### Team Folder Restriction

Restricts Google Drive access to a designated folder for team members:

- Workspace owners designate a specific Google Drive folder as "Team Folder"
- Team members can only access templates within this folder
- Workspace owners retain full Google Drive access

<Warning>
**Important:** Without a Team Folder restriction, all team members will have access to all folders and Google Docs in the authorized Google Drive.
</Warning>
