## Important Limitations

<Warning>
**PDF Attachments**: Printed PDFs will be added as attachments to your tasks. Currently, new PDFs are added and there is no option to overwrite previous attachments (a ClickUp limitation).

**Workspace Restriction**: Only one team/workspace is allowed currently. If multiple workspaces are selected when connecting ClickUp, only the first one is available for data mapping.
</Warning>
