The Unlimited plan grants users freedom to scale document generation without hard limits, contingent on adherence to fair use principles designed to maintain platform stability for all customers.

## What's Included

The Unlimited plan provides:

- Unrestricted document generation
- Unlimited automations and templates
- Unlimited team seats
- DocsAutomator eSign with unrestricted signatures
- Chat and video support
- Full feature access

## Fair Use Guidelines

### Single Organization Use

The plan serves individual businesses or organizations. Team members should be employees, contractors, or direct collaborators of that entity.

### Business Operations Only

The subscription is for internal business needs and cannot be:
- Resold or white-labeled as a service
- Used to operate multiple unrelated businesses simultaneously
- Offered as third-party infrastructure

### Reasonable Usage Patterns

While no document generation caps exist, usage should align with normal business operations. Seasonal peaks and large projects are acceptable.

<Warning>
The following patterns are flagged as problematic:
- Automated scripts generating documents at system-impacting rates
- Sustained extreme volume beyond typical business requirements
- Bulk generation for spam or unsolicited marketing
</Warning>

### Lawful and Ethical Use

Documents must serve legitimate purposes. eSignature collection should occur within authorized workflows only.

## Technical Boundaries

Despite unlimited documents, operational constraints exist:

| Constraint | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| API rate limits | Ensure system stability |
| Concurrent processing limits | Prevent queue congestion |

<Info>
These limits are generous and won't affect standard business use.
</Info>

## Enforcement Approach

We prioritize dialogue. When unusual activity appears:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact">
    Our team initiates contact to understand the use case
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collaborate">
    We work collaboratively toward solutions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolution">
    Suspension is reserved for clear misuse or harmful activity
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Action only occurs without prior communication if activity is demonstrably malicious or fraudulent.
</Note>

## Our Commitment

The Unlimited plan empowers business growth without administrative overhead. Most customers will never encounter policy restrictions.
