## Problem

When generating documents via an Airtable automation script, requests that exceed 120 seconds fail with an error. This is an Airtable platform limitation on automation script execution time.

<Warning>
Airtable enforces a 120-second (2 minute) execution limit on all automation scripts. Complex documents may exceed this limit.
</Warning>

## Solution

Add `async: true` to your automation script. This allows the script to execute asynchronously without blocking on the DocsAutomator request.

### Implementation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Automation Settings">
    Navigate to the bottom of your DocsAutomator automation configuration page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Async Mode">
    Locate the toggle to enable async mode and turn it on
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Script">
    When enabled, a code snippet with `async: true` becomes available. Copy this adjusted script from the code area.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Airtable">
    Paste the updated script into your Airtable automation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

The asynchronous approach prevents the 120-second timeout by allowing Airtable to process the script without waiting for the complete response from DocsAutomator. This enables longer document generation processes to complete successfully.

<Info>
With async mode enabled, the script returns immediately and DocsAutomator continues processing in the background. The generated PDF will still be saved to your specified attachment field.
