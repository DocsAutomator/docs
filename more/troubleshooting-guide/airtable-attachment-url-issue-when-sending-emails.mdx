## Problem

When sending generated files as attachments via Airtable automation, you receive an attachment URL error message: "an attachment url is disallowed"

## Root Cause

The automation fires before the attachment is fully uploaded to Airtable's storage system, causing the URL to become invalid.

## Solution

Implement a waiting mechanism using a formula field that matches Airtable's file storage URL pattern. This ensures the file upload completes before the automation triggers.

### Implementation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Formula Field">
    Add a formula field in your Airtable table that checks for valid attachment URLs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Condition to Automation">
    Configure your automation to only trigger when the formula field indicates the attachment is ready
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Workflow">
    Run a test to ensure the automation waits for the attachment to fully upload
  </Step>
</Steps>
