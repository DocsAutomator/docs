## Problem

When generating documents from Airtable, DocsAutomator requires a valid Record ID to know which record to use for document generation. Without this, the process fails.

## Error Location

The error typically appears:
- In Airtable automation scripts on the right side of the script window
- Often accompanied by a red squiggly line under the variable name in the code editor

## Solution

### Check Input Variables

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Input Variables">
    Navigate to the **Input variables** section on the left side of your Airtable automation script
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Record ID">
    Verify that a record ID has been properly defined
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Variable Name">
    Ensure the variable name is spelled exactly as `recId` (case-sensitive)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configure Correctly

To fix the issue:

1. Select the **record id field** from your input variables dropdown
2. Name this variable `recId` with the correct capitalization
3. Confirm the variable appears without error indicators in your script

<Warning>
The variable must be named exactly `recId` (case-sensitive). Common mistakes include:
- `RecId` (wrong capitalization)
- `record_id` (wrong format)
- `recordId` (wrong format)
</Warning>

## Why This Matters

DocsAutomator needs a valid Record ID to be passed so that it knows for which record you're trying to generate a document. Without this identifier, the system cannot retrieve the correct data for your template.
