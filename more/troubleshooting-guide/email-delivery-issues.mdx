## Emails Not Being Sent

### Problem

You have email delivery configured on your automation, but emails are not being sent after document generation.

### Causes & Solutions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Email not enabled">
    Verify that email sending is turned on in your automation's output settings. Go to your automation page and check the **Send Email** section under output options.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Missing recipient">
    The recipient email address field must contain a valid email address. If the field is empty or contains an invalid email, the email will not be sent.

    Check that the email field in your data source has a value for the record being processed.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Condition not met">
    If you have email conditions configured (e.g., only send when a certain field equals a value), verify the condition is being met for the record in question.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Document generation failed">
    Emails are only sent when the document is successfully generated. Check the Run History tab to see if the document generation itself failed.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Gmail Sender Setup

### Problem

You want to send emails from your own Gmail address instead of the default DocsAutomator sender, but emails are still coming from DocsAutomator.

### Solution

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Google account">
    Go to **Settings > Integrations** and ensure your Google account is connected with Gmail permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure email sender">
    In your automation's email output settings, select **Gmail** as the sender instead of the default DocsAutomator option.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Gmail account">
    Choose which connected Gmail account to send from. If you have multiple Google accounts connected, select the appropriate one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set sender name (optional)">
    You can customize the "From" name that recipients see. If left blank, your Gmail account name will be used.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Using Gmail as the sender means emails come from your own email address, which can improve deliverability and allow recipients to reply directly to you.

## Attachment Issues

### Problem

The generated PDF is not attached to the email, or the attachment fails.

### Common Causes

- **PDF generation failed**: If the PDF could not be generated, there is nothing to attach. Check Run History for errors.
- **File too large**: Very large PDFs (with many high-resolution images) may exceed email attachment limits. Optimize images in your template.
- **Airtable attachment URLs**: If you're forwarding Airtable attachment URLs in emails, these temporary URLs may have expired by the time the email is sent. See the [Airtable Attachment URL Issue](/more/troubleshooting-guide/airtable-attachment-url-issue-when-sending-emails) guide.

## Test Email Rate Limit

### Problem

You receive an error when trying to send a test email, with a message indicating you've exceeded the rate limit.

### Details

Test emails are rate-limited to **25 per hour per automation**. This limit applies to the `POST /sendTestEmail` endpoint and the "Send Test Email" button in the app.

### Solution

- Wait for the rate limit window to reset (1 hour from your first test email)
- Use the document preview feature to verify your template before sending test emails
- Test with actual document generation on a single record instead of the test email function

<Warning>
The 25-per-hour limit is per automation. Each automation has its own separate quota.
</Warning>

## Emails Going to Spam

### Problem

Emails sent by DocsAutomator are landing in recipients' spam folders.

### Solutions

- **Use Gmail sender**: Emails from your own Gmail address are less likely to be flagged as spam than emails from the default DocsAutomator sender
- **Avoid spam trigger words**: Review your email subject and body for common spam trigger words
- **Ask recipients to whitelist**: Have recipients add the sender address to their contacts or safe sender list
- **Check email content**: Excessively large attachments, many links, or all-caps subject lines can trigger spam filters

## Email Customization

### Available Options

DocsAutomator supports customizing the following email fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Subject | Email subject line (supports placeholders) |
| Body | Email body content (supports placeholders) |
| Sender | DocsAutomator default or your Gmail account |
| Sender name | Custom "From" name (Gmail only) |
| Button color | CTA button color in the email template |

<Tip>
You can use placeholders in both the email subject and body. For example, use `{{customer_name}}` in the subject line to personalize each email.
