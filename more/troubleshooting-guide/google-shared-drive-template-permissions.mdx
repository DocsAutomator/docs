## Problem

When selecting a Google Docs template from a Shared Drive, DocsAutomator checks if your authorized Google account has the necessary permissions. If permissions are insufficient, a red Template Check badge appears.

## Why This Happens

<Warning>
Google Shared Drive files require **Manager** (Organizer) level permissions for API operations, even if you can view and edit the template manually.
</Warning>

DocsAutomator uses the Google Drive API to read templates and create documents, which necessitates elevated permissions.

## Identifying the Issue

- 🔴 Red Template Check Badge indicates a permission problem
- Hovering shows your Google account email and current role
- Errors appear in both minimized and expanded template sections

## Permission Requirements

| Your Role | Can Use Template? |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Manager (Organizer) | ✅ Yes |
| Content Manager | ❌ No |
| Contributor | ❌ No |
| Commenter | ❌ No |
| Viewer | ❌ No |

## Solutions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Option 1: Upgrade Role">
    Contact your Shared Drive Manager to upgrade the authorized Google account to **Manager** status.

    This is the recommended solution if you need ongoing access to templates in the Shared Drive.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Option 2: Switch Accounts">
    1. Disconnect your current Google account in DocsAutomator settings
    2. Reconnect with an account that has Manager permissions

    <Info>
    Verify which account has Manager access before switching.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Option 3: Copy Template">
    1. Open the template in Google Docs
    2. Select **File → Make a copy**
    3. Save to "My Drive"
    4. Select the copied template in DocsAutomator

    <Tip>
    This creates a personal copy you fully control, but you'll need to update it manually if the original changes.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Prevention Tips

- Assign Manager roles to authorized Google accounts for team use
- Store frequently-used templates in personal drives
- Ensure proper Shared Drive permissions before setting up automations

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after permission changes:
1. Refresh the DocsAutomator page to re-check permissions
2. Verify you selected the correct template
3. Confirm your Google account reconnection completed successfully
