## Polling Not Triggering

### Problem

Your Google Sheets automation is set to auto-polling, but new or updated rows are not triggering document generation.

### Causes & Solutions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Automation is inactive">
    Verify your automation is active. Go to your automation settings and check the status toggle is turned on.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Polling interval">
    Auto-polling checks for new rows periodically. Allow a few minutes for the next poll cycle to detect your changes.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Google account disconnected">
    If your Google account token has expired, DocsAutomator cannot access the sheet. Go to **Settings > Integrations** and reconnect your Google account.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Row already processed">
    DocsAutomator tracks which rows have been processed. If a row was already generated, it won't be processed again unless you clear the tracking column.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Manual Trigger Queue Issues

### Problem

When using manual trigger mode with Google Sheets, documents are queued but not completing, or the queue appears stuck.

### Solution

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check queue status">
    Open your automation and check the queue panel. Each workspace is limited to 50 queued jobs and 5 active jobs at a time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Google connection">
    Go to **Settings > Integrations** and confirm your Google account is connected. An expired token will cause all queued jobs to fail.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check run history">
    Open the Run History tab to see if jobs are failing with specific error messages. Common causes include missing template permissions or quota limits.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
If many jobs fail at once, it's usually a connection issue. Fix the root cause, then re-trigger the failed rows.
</Info>

## Row Number Problems

### Problem

Documents are generated with data from the wrong row, or the row number reference doesn't match what you expect.

### Causes

- **Header row**: DocsAutomator treats the first row as headers. Row 2 in your sheet is row number 1 in the data.
- **Empty rows**: Blank rows in the middle of your sheet can cause row numbering to shift unexpectedly.
- **Filtered views**: If your sheet has active filters, the visible row numbers differ from the actual row positions.

### Solution

1. Ensure your sheet has no empty rows between data rows
2. Remove any active filters before triggering document generation
3. Remember that row numbering starts at 2 (row 1 is the header row)

## Formula Fields Not Resolving

### Problem

Placeholder values show formula expressions instead of the computed results, or appear blank.

### Causes & Solutions

- **Volatile formulas**: Some formulas (like `NOW()`, `RAND()`) may not resolve in time. Add a small delay or use static values where possible.
- **Cross-sheet references**: Formulas referencing other sheets may take longer to calculate. Ensure all referenced sheets are accessible.
- **Error values**: If a formula returns `#ERROR!`, `#REF!`, or `#N/A`, DocsAutomator will pass the error string as the value. Fix the formula in your sheet first.

<Warning>
Make sure all formula cells have finished calculating before triggering document generation. Google Sheets may show a "Loading..." indicator while formulas are still computing.
</Warning>

## Webhook Formula Showing #ERROR

### Problem

The webhook formula you pasted into Google Sheets shows a `#ERROR!` result.

### Solution

This typically happens when your Google Sheets language is not set to English. The formula syntax uses English function names and comma separators.

1. Go to **File > Settings** in your Google Sheet
2. Change the **Locale** to an English-speaking region (e.g., United States)
3. Re-paste the webhook formula from DocsAutomator

<Info>
Alternatively, you can manually translate the function names and replace commas with semicolons for your locale.
