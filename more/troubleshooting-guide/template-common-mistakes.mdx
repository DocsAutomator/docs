## Placeholder Not Being Replaced

### Problem

A placeholder in your template (e.g., `{{customer_name}}`) appears in the generated document instead of being replaced with actual data.

### Causes & Solutions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Name mismatch">
    The placeholder name in your template must exactly match the field name from your data source. Placeholder names are **case-sensitive**.

    | Template | Data Field | Result |
    |----------|-----------|--------|
    | `{{customer_name}}` | `customer_name` | Replaced |
    | `{{Customer_Name}}` | `customer_name` | Not replaced |
    | `{{customer name}}` | `customer_name` | Not replaced |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hidden formatting">
    Google Docs may insert invisible formatting characters inside your placeholder brackets, especially if you typed the brackets and placeholder name separately, or copy-pasted from another source.

    **Solution:**
    1. Delete the entire placeholder text in Google Docs
    2. Type the full placeholder (including `{{` and `}}`) in one go without pausing
    3. Or copy the placeholder from a plain text editor and paste it into Google Docs
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Smart quotes">
    Google Docs may auto-convert straight quotes to curly/smart quotes inside placeholders. While this primarily affects text content, some formatters may also alter bracket characters.

    **Solution:** Disable smart quotes in **Tools > Preferences** and uncheck "Use smart quotes."
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Field not mapped">
    If you're using a data source with field mapping (Airtable, SmartSuite, etc.), ensure the field is properly mapped in your automation settings.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Mismatched Placeholder Brackets

### Problem

You see errors or unreplaced placeholders because the opening `{{` and closing `}}` brackets don't match.

### Common Mistakes

```
{{customer_name}     -- Missing closing bracket
{customer_name}}     -- Missing opening bracket
{{ customer_name }}   -- Spaces inside brackets (these work, but watch for consistency)
{{customer_name}}}   -- Extra closing bracket
```

### Solution

Always use exactly two opening braces `{{` and two closing braces `}}`. Use the Template Check feature in DocsAutomator to validate your template before generating documents.

<Tip>
The Template Check badge on your automation page validates all placeholders. A green badge means all placeholders are properly formatted and mapped.
</Tip>

## Line Item Syntax Issues

### Problem

Line item rows are not being generated, or the table shows raw placeholder text.

### Common Mistakes

1. **Missing table row**: Line item placeholders must be placed inside a table row in your Google Docs template. They cannot be used in regular paragraph text.

2. **Wrong prefix**: Line item placeholders use the format `{{line_items_N_fieldName}}` where N is the line item group number (1, 2, 3, etc.).

3. **Inconsistent group numbers**: All placeholders in the same table row must use the same group number.

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| `{{line_items_1_description}}` | `{{line_items_description}}` (missing group number) |
| `{{line_items_1_price}}` | `{{lineItems_1_price}}` (wrong format) |

### Solution

1. Place all line item placeholders in a single table row
2. Use the correct `line_items_N_` prefix format
3. Ensure the field names after the prefix match your data source fields exactly

## Special Characters in Placeholder Names

### Problem

Placeholders with special characters in their names fail to be replaced.

### Rules for Placeholder Names

- Use only letters, numbers, and underscores
- Do not use spaces, hyphens, periods, or other special characters in placeholder names
- Start with a letter or underscore, not a number

| Valid | Invalid |
|-------|---------|
| `{{customer_name}}` | `{{customer-name}}` |
| `{{address_line_1}}` | `{{address.line.1}}` |
| `{{total_amount}}` | `{{total amount}}` |

<Warning>
If your data source field names contain special characters (e.g., Airtable field "Customer Name"), DocsAutomator's field mapping automatically converts them. Check the mapped placeholder name in your automation settings.
</Warning>

## Conditional Section Not Working

### Problem

A conditional section (`{{#if condition}}...{{/if}}`) is not showing or hiding as expected.

### Common Causes

- **Truthy/falsy values**: Empty strings, `null`, `undefined`, and `false` evaluate as falsy (section hidden). Non-empty strings, numbers, and `true` evaluate as truthy (section shown).
- **Whitespace**: A field that appears empty might contain whitespace. Trim values in your data source.
- **Wrong placeholder name**: The condition field name must match a field in your data, just like regular placeholders.

## Image Placeholder Issues

### Problem

Dynamic image placeholders are not rendering the image, or the image appears broken.

### Common Causes

- **Invalid URL**: The image URL must be publicly accessible. Private or authenticated URLs will not work.
- **URL expired**: Some data sources (like Airtable) generate temporary attachment URLs that expire. Ensure the URL is still valid.
- **Image too large**: Very large images may cause timeouts. Optimize images before using them in templates.
