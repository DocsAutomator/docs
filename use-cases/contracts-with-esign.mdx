Generate contracts from data and collect legally binding electronic signatures from one or more parties using DocsAutomator eSign.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you will have an automation that:

- Generates a personalized contract from a template
- Sends the contract to one or more signers for electronic signature
- Tracks signing status and sends reminders
- Saves the fully signed PDF back to your data source

## Prerequisites

- A DocsAutomator paid plan with the eSign add-on enabled
- A Google account for creating the template
- A data source (this guide covers API, but the same principles apply to Airtable, Google Sheets, and other sources)

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the Contract Template">
    Create a Google Doc with your contract text and add placeholders for dynamic content and e-signature fields.

    **Data placeholders:**

    | Placeholder | Purpose |
    |-------------|---------|
    | `{{client_name}}` | Client's full name |
    | `{{client_email}}` | Client's email address |
    | `{{company_name}}` | Your company name |
    | `{{contract_date}}` | Date of the contract |
    | `{{contract_id}}` | Unique contract identifier |
    | `{{scope_of_work}}` | Description of services |
    | `{{total_amount}}` | Contract value |

    **E-signature placeholders:**

    | Placeholder | Purpose |
    |-------------|---------|
    | `{{esign.signature_1}}` | Client's signature |
    | `{{esign.date_1}}` | Client's signing date (auto-filled) |
    | `{{esign.text_1_printedname}}` | Client's typed name or title |
    | `{{esign.signature_2}}` | Your company's signature |
    | `{{esign.date_2}}` | Your company's signing date |

    <Note>
    The number after each e-sign placeholder (1, 2, etc.) corresponds to the signer number. Signer 1 sees fields tagged with `_1`, signer 2 sees fields tagged with `_2`, and so on.
    </Note>

    Place the signature placeholders where you want them to appear in the final document, typically at the bottom of the contract.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the Automation">
    1. Click **+ New Automation** in your DocsAutomator dashboard
    2. Name it "Client Contracts"
    3. Select your data source:
       - **API** for programmatic contract generation
       - **Airtable**, **Google Sheets**, or another source for UI-based workflows
    4. Select your contract template
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map Fields to Placeholders">
    Connect your data source fields to the template placeholders.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="API">
        When using the API, placeholders are mapped automatically from the `data` object in your request. No additional mapping is needed in the UI.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Airtable / Google Sheets">
        Map each placeholder to the corresponding field or column in your data source using the field mapping interface.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable E-Signatures">
    In your automation's output settings, enable the **E-Signature** section. DocsAutomator automatically detects e-sign placeholders in your template.

    **Configure signers:**

    For each signer, provide:
    - **Email**: Where the signing invitation is sent (use a placeholder like `{{client_email}}` for dynamic values)
    - **Name** (optional): Displayed in the signing portal

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="2 Signers (Client + Company)">
        - **Signer 1**: Client -- email from `{{client_email}}`, name from `{{client_name}}`
        - **Signer 2**: Your company representative -- enter a static email and name
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="1 Signer (Client Only)">
        - **Signer 1**: Client -- email from `{{client_email}}`, name from `{{client_name}}`
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    **Signing order:**

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Parallel (Default)" icon="users">
        Both parties receive the signing invitation simultaneously and can sign in any order.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Sequential" icon="list-ol">
        Signer 1 receives the invitation first. Signer 2 receives theirs only after Signer 1 completes.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Signing Emails">
    Customize the three email types sent during the signing workflow:

    1. **Invitation email**: Sent when a signing request is created
    2. **Reminder email**: Sent to signers who haven't completed signing
    3. **Completion email**: Sent to all parties once everyone has signed

    Use template variables in your emails:
    - `{{documentName}}` -- the contract name
    - `{{signerName}}` -- the recipient's name
    - `{{signButton:Sign Now}}` -- a call-to-action button (invitation/reminder only)
    - `{{downloadButton:Download}}` -- download link (completion email only)

    **Email sender options:**
    - **DocsAutomator Mail**: Sent from DocsAutomator's infrastructure (default)
    - **Gmail**: Sent from your connected Gmail account for a branded experience

    **Reminders:**
    Enable automatic reminders and set the interval (e.g., every 3 days) and maximum number of reminders.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Additional Output Actions">
    Beyond e-signatures, set up additional post-generation actions:

    - **Save signed PDF to data source**: Automatically saves the completed signed PDF back to your Airtable attachment field, Google Sheets column, etc.
    - **Save to Google Drive**: Archive signed contracts in a specific Drive folder
    - **Notify webhook**: Send a POST request with the signed PDF URL and signer details when signing completes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the Workflow">
    Generate a test contract to verify the full flow:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="API">
        Send a test request:

        ```bash
        curl -X POST https://api.docsautomator.co/createDocument \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "docId": "YOUR_AUTOMATION_ID",
            "data": {
              "client_name": "Jane Smith",
              "client_email": "jane@example.com",
              "company_name": "Acme Corp",
              "contract_date": "February 10, 2025",
              "contract_id": "CONTRACT-001",
              "scope_of_work": "Website redesign and development",
              "total_amount": "$15,000"
            }
          }'
        ```

        The response includes:
        ```json
        {
          "success": true,
          "pdfUrl": "https://...",
          "signingSessionId": "session_abc123",
          "signingLinks": [
            { "email": "jane@example.com", "url": "https://sign.docsautomator.co/..." }
          ]
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Airtable / Google Sheets">
        Use the preview function to generate a test document, or trigger generation from a test record. Check your email for the signing invitation.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Signing Status">
    Track signing progress in the DocsAutomator dashboard or via the API:

    - **Dashboard**: View all signing sessions with status indicators (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Declined, Expired)
    - **API**: Call `GET /esign/sessions/{sessionId}` for detailed status
    - **Webhooks**: Receive automatic notifications when signing completes

    | Status | Meaning |
    |--------|---------|
    | Pending | Created, waiting for signers to open |
    | In Progress | At least one signer has started |
    | Completed | All signers have finished |
    | Declined | A signer declined to sign |
    | Expired | Signing link expired before completion |
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Delivery Methods

DocsAutomator supports two ways to deliver signing requests:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Email Delivery (Default)">
    Signers receive an email with a link to the signing portal. This is the simplest approach and works for most use cases.

    - Invitation emails are sent automatically when the document is generated
    - Reminders can be configured to follow up with unsigned parties
    - Completion emails notify all parties when signing is done
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Link Delivery">
    Retrieve signing URLs from the API response or dashboard and deliver them through your own channels (in-app notifications, SMS, custom emails, etc.).

    ```json
    {
      "signingLinks": [
        {
          "email": "jane@example.com",
          "url": "https://sign.docsautomator.co/..."
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    <Info>
    Signing links expire after the configured expiration period (default: 30 days).
